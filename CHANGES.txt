0.5.0 (December XX, 2023)
 - Added support for Flag Sets, which enables grouping feature flags and interacting with the group rather than individually (more details in our documentation).
 - Added a new Split Filter type named 'bySet'. This allows the Synchronizer to only synchronize the flags in the specified flag sets, avoiding unused or unwanted flags from being synced on the pluggable storage instance, bringing all the benefits of a reduced payload.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.12.0, which includes support for flag sets, vulnerability fixes and other improvements.

0.4.0 (August 31, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.9.0 that includes a minor improvement:
    - Updated streaming architecture implementation to apply feature flag updates from the notification received which is now enhanced, improving efficiency and reliability of the whole update system.
 - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

0.3.1 (May 15, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.8.2 that includes minor improvements.
    - Updated terminology on the SDKs codebase to be more aligned with current standard without causing a breaking change. The core change is the term split for feature flag on things like logs and IntelliSense comments.
    - Updated split storage modules to optimize some operations when using Redis and pluggable storages.

0.3.0 (May 4, 2023)
 - Added an optional error-first callback parameter to `execute` method, to be called when the synchronization is finished, with an error object if it finished unsuccessfully.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons and other dependencies for vulnerability fixes and performance improvements.
 - Bugfixing - Fixed `execute` method to ensure the returned promise resolves to `false` if any synchronization task fails (i.e., synchronization of feature flags, segments, impressions or events).
 - Bugfixing - Fixed `execute` method to await storage destroy promise and handle rejections.

0.2.0 (October 5, 2022)
 - Added support for synchronizing telemetry data, impression counts and unique keys in pluggable storage.
 - Updated impressions POST to Split cloud in order to send a minified payload.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-commons and other dependencies for vulnerability fixes and performance improvements.

0.1.1 (July 12, 2022)
 - Updated some dependencies for vulnerability fixes.

0.1.0 (January 11, 2022)
